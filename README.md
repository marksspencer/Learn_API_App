# Learn_API_App
This project is designed to serve three aims:
- learn how to use Python + Flask to build a simple Learn_API_App
- learn how to use DockerHub as a repository for docker containers
- learn how to set up a working pipeline to:
-- automagically update the DockerHub container when new code is pushed to Master branch
-- automoatically update the container on Heroku when a container is refreshed on DockerHub
-- build web-accessible APIs which could be simple RESTful Request/Response queries, or to take input parameters, manipulate them & return a response (like calculate tax, for example).
